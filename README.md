Inspiration
I was inspired to create Cafe menu App because I love food and I love technology. I wanted to create an app that would make it easy for people to order food from their favorite restaurants, and I also wanted to learn more about how to build mobile apps.

Technical Challenge
The biggest technical challenge I faced when building Cafe menu App was integrating with the API of a third-party food delivery service. I had to learn how to use the API to get the data I needed, and I also had to learn how to handle errors that might occur when communicating with the API.

Struggles
I struggled with a few things when building Cafe menu App. First, I had to learn a lot of new things about mobile app development. I had never built a mobile app before, so I had to learn about things like user interface design, app architecture, and mobile app testing. Second, I had to learn how to use the API of a third-party food delivery service. This was a bit challenging, but I was able to find some helpful resources online.

Next Iteration
I'm still working on improving Cafe menu App. In the next iteration, I plan to add the following features:

The ability to save favorite restaurants The ability to track order status The ability to rate and review restaurants
